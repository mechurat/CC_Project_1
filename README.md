# CC_Project_1
Project 1 for Creative Coding

## Adjective: Neverending
This project will feature an interactive animation of a stick figure swimming through a pool.

Clicking will make his head turn to breath
* this fills up the bar on the upper right corner
* try not to let him lose breath!

If the breath bar runs out, he will automatically start treading water

Random Function will be part of waves

Lots of loops and if statements to make an unlimited amount of waves and keep the memory clean
* deleted anything that goes off screen on the left
